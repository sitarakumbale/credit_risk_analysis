# credit_risk_analysis

The aim of this project is to classify an individual loan applicant as creditworthy (likely to repay the loan back to the bank) or non-creditworthy (unlikely to repay the loan back to the bank). A Deep Learning Neural Network is used for this classification and Data is considered from banks across Europe.
